### Microservices Reference Application - What's For Dinner User-Interface Service

*This project is part of the 'IBM Cloud Architecture - Microservices Reference Application for Netflix OSS' suite, available at
https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-wfd*.  There are three versions of the application, each available in their own branch, as documented below.

- [Microprofile](../../tree/microprofile/) - leverages the Microprofile framework for the Java microservices framework of choice.
- [Spring](../../tree/spring/) - leverages Spring Boot as the Java programming model of choice, with reliance on Kubernetes-based routing for microservices communication.
- [Spring Cloud](../../tree/spring-cloud/) - leverages the Spring Cloud programming model (including Netflix OSS componentes) as the Java microservices framework of choice.
